# Text Detection With Opencv

In this Project we have used Opencv and easyocr to very easily build a simple ready to go ocr solution for text detection.
For testing out play with the code in file `main.py`

Here are the result

| Column 1               | Column 2               |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| ![Image 1](image1.jpg) | ![Image 2](image2.jpg) |
| ![Image 3](image3.jpg) | ![Image 4](image4.jpg) |
| ![Image 5](image5.jpg) | ![Image 6](image6.jpg) |
